            <h3>PWINT YI NANDAR, FOUNDER AND HEAD DIRECTRESS</h3>

            <p>
                After finishing my bachelor degree, I decided to pursue my further education in London. Although I studied cheimcal engineering during my university years, I always knew that I had passion for working with children. When my father introduced me to the Montessori philosophy, I instantly fell in love with it and how the Montessori "prepared" environment helps children develop. I enrolled at Montessori Centre International (London) and got accepted. I graduated in 2010 and I was offered a Montessori teacher teacher.After staying at Ladybird Montessori Nursery for over a year, I decided it was time to set up my own Montessori setting.

                I would say Maple Montessori Preschool is the outcome of a directress who is passionate about teaching and creating an authentic Montessori environment. I am very keen to put my experience and knowledge into practice and look forward to supporting children on their learning jounerys.
