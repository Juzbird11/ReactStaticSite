            <h2>ABOUT THE SCHOOL</h2>

            <h3>OUR ETHOS</h3>
            <p>
                At Maple Montessori, we believe in creating a nurturing and inspiring setting where children aged 2 to 5 years old are encouraged to blossom at their own pace and develop a lifelong love of learning.
            </p>

            <p>
                Children learn in different ways and to ensure their needs are catered for, our teachers support spontaneous learning and aspire to implement Maria Montessori's approach based on the individual developmental requirements of the child. Our curriculum covers all areas of the EYFS (Early Years Foundation Stage) and includes all children.
            </p>

            <h3>OUR ENVIRONMENT</h3>
            <p>
                Our thoughtfully prepared environment fosters children's holistic development and enables them to fully benefit from comprehensive subjects which include activities of everday living sensorial, literacy,  numeracy, understanding and knowledge of the world, culture, creativity, music and extra-curricular activities enrichment such as French,yoga and drama. Children have free access to high quality Montessori learning materials throughout the day. In addition, our curriculum prepares children for a harmonious transition between preschool and primary education.
            </p>

            <p>
                Opportunities for learning and growth are created both indoors and outdoors.Our Montessori classrooms and garden allow children to move, touch and learn without interruption and reach high level of concentration. Our child sized environment and autodidactic materials nurtures engagement, independence, enjoyment and problem-sloving skills. Purposeful play is encouraged by our teachers and is recognised as an essential factor of cognitive, motro and social skills, as well as language development and general well-being.
            </p>

            <p>
                The mix of ages, one of essential features of the Montessori environment, fosters a sense of community. Our teachers are dedicated to promote positive relationships not only between children's themselves but also between children and adults.
            </p>

            <h3>WORKING TOGETHER</h3>
            <p>
                At Maple Montessori, a key worker system is placed for the children to settle in happily as well as gaining a sense of security. Children are well supported to progress in all areas of learning and reach their full potential through observation, assessment and planning. By working in partnership with parents and carers, we hope to provide the best learning experiences at the setting as well as at home for the children. Aside from daily communication, parents and carers will have access to the child's Learning Journal and the school newsletter.
